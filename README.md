### Course Description
Senior Project in Digital Media is the capstone course for the Integrated Digital Media \(IDM\) program. This course mirrors the creative process that professional artists, designers, creative technologists, and entrepreneurs must practice throughout their entire careers. In order to succeed, this course requires you to devote a lot of time and effort outside of class, throughout the entire semester.

The primary goal for the student is to develop a hunger and passion for self-directed, life-long learning and creativity. To achieve this students will involve themselves in a semester-long capstone project that includes a robust investigation of all phases of the creative process, including research, design, development, and user testing for the production of a substantial and mature body of work, representing their creative and conceptual skills as artists, designers, creative technologists, and/or entrepreneurs.

As you engage in the rigorous practice of a professional artist, designer, or entrepreneur, your project will naturally evolve and change, and may in fact take quite a different shape than what you propose in the beginning of the semester. This is normal and OK.

The Senior Project can take many forms, including but not limited to the following:

* a screen-based, digital application \(website, mobile app, game, etc.\)
* a physical object, musical instrument, physical game, or interactive installation
* a performance or event,
* a moving image \(animation, film, motion graphics, video web series, etc.\)
* audio \(podcast, etc.\)
* print medium

The Senior Project **can also be a team-based project** if your teammate is also taking Senior Project in any section _this semester_.

### IDM Program objectives
The following IDM program goals are reinforced within this course. Students will:
* develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
  * Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
  * Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
  * Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.
* develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

### Learning outcomes
This course will help students to:
* determine, communicate, and accomplish your own vision and goals for your senior project. 
* practice an iterative design process in conjunction with effective project & time management skills.
* continue to hone all aspects of professional communication about your creative process and work through discourse, presentations, and writing.

By the end of the course, students will be able to develop, complete, and document a body of work that is meaningful and carefully crafted to be used for professional purposes \(employment, gallery shows, starting a business, etc.\).

### Important Dates
* Wed September 9, first class meeting
* Tuesday, September 15 last day of drop/add
* Monday, November 30 last day to withdraw with a W
* Thurs, November 26 - Friday, November 27 Thanksgiving break, no classes
* Sunday, December 13 last day of classes

### Course structure
Students are expected to be on time for all individual meetings, critiques, project demos, and presentations.

This class will consist of :

* **Individual Meetings** Be prepared to present and discuss your work at your appointed time. Students should plan ahead and ensure that technical requirements necessary for the review of work are addressed _prior_ to meeting with the instructor. Also, have any required documents ready, as well.  

Individual meetings are not optional. They are important and useful. Sometimes they are most useful exactly when you feel you have nothing to talk about or show. It is normal that you may sometimes have nothing "good" to show, or even nothing at all. It is still important that you keep your appointment so that we can talk about that. If for some unusual reason you cannot make your appointment one week, please swap times with a classmate.

* **Group and class critiques**
Critiques \(AKA crits\) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the aural, visual, and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Have at least your [accountability partner](assignments/accountability_partner.md) or another classmate take notes for you when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project.

**Rules of the critique:**

* Be present and engaged.
* Give feedback to your classmates. 
* Do not make assumptions. Ask questions.
* Do your best.
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

**Guidelines for the critique:**

* What is working about the project?
* What is confusing or needs more clarification about the project?
* What are ways that the project can be improved?
* What additional references, resources, projects, and/or links that would be useful for the project?

### Documentation Website
Please add your name and the URL of your process website to this [shared google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mKKHRFi-W3GdVgWUSxoPL---7qcGSEt6qx7Z2y-83T4/edit?usp=sharing).

You should have a **dedicated**, senior project website to document your **daily** and/or **weekly** process and progress of your senior project. Students are expected to share their process and progress with others using their "process" website.

* **Ideally under your own domain name with a folder named after your project.** See Spencer's link below under "Example Process Websites". 
  * I recommend [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com) or [Siteground](http://siteground.com) for purchasing a domain and web hosting.
* Second best is hosting on [http://wp.nyu.edu](http://wp.nyu.edu)

#### What your senior project documentation website should contain?

* Daily/Weekly senior project process & progress \(AKA what have you done today or this week?\) 
* at least, 1 post per week DUE by or before noon on Mondays. If it is not posted by noon, you will not receive credit for this week.
* If you do not do anything for the week, write **I did not work on my senior project this week.** You will still get credit as opposed to not posting anything at all.
* The majority of the posts should be your own writing \(well-composed and proofread for impeccable spelling and grammar\).
* Make sure to use tags so that you can group certain kinds of info.
  * Milestones / tasks that have been completed \(either transcribed or linked from your personal kanban or a screenshot or photo\).
  * Include who or what was involved.
  * Include project progress and prototyping documentation: images, illustrations, audio, video, code, snippets of research, ANNOTATED links, etc. relevant to your thesis. 
  * Accountability partner meeting notes.
  * Document any feedback from interviews, meetings, exhibitions, or presentations about your project.
  * pdfs of any presentations \(annotated\).
  * Notes taken about your project, prototypes, and presentations by you or your accountability partner.
  * Notes on problems, challenges or questions that have arisen in your project development. Discuss what is and what is not working.
* _Sourced & Annotated Research / Reference / Inspiration_
  * Research: If you found projects, books, articles, exhibitions, talks. or other research materials that help with your chosen topic or you conducted materials, tech, or visual research, provide a link to them \(if applicable\), photo or video documentation \(if applicable\), and a short written description of it and how you will use this research for your project.
  * Sourced means where did you get this from? if it is a website, provide a link. If it is a book, provide a bibliography. If it is an image, where did you get it from? If it is a quote, who said it or who did you poll or interview?
  * Annotated means with notes. You don’t have to write a novel. 1 to 2 thoughtful, contextual sentences is more than enough. So, “This was inspirational,” would not be a good note as it provides no context for your thesis. However, “This book discusses how nostalgia is a useless emotion because nostalgia is based on the past. This point of view is antithetical to my thesis because I’m trying to demonstrate how the sentimentality of nostalgia is valuable to the human experience.” is a viable note.\)
* _An About Page_
  * Your project themes in 1 to 3 hashtags
  * Your project “elevator pitch” in one sentence
  * Your project description in a paragraph
  * Eventually hi-res image\(s\)

#### What your process website should NOT contain?
* How you are feeling about your senior project? This is different than evaluating or reflecting about what is working and what is not working. In other words, don’t rant, complain, blame, self-deprecate or make excuses on your senior project website. 
* This is a public representation of you as an artist, designer, creative technologist and/or entrepreneur. **You want it to be as professional as possible. You want prospective employers, gallery owners, venture capitalists, and/or possible collaborators to take you seriously.**
* Any content that is NOT related to your senior project explicitly.

#### Examples of Process Websites
Spencer Hargiss’ process website is a good example, [http://www.spencerhargiss.com/thesis/](http://www.spencerhargiss.com/thesis/). Please use Spencer’s process website as a guide. Why?

* You can clearly read what his project was about due to his about link. You don’t have to wade through to the beginning of his posts to find this out. His navigation stands out due to its visual hierarchy.
* He explicitly stated what he did, concisely and clearly.
* He had visual documentation \(images and screenshots\). 
* However, most importantly, he had supporting text for these images and screenshots.

Also the following pdf contain excellent examples of possible entries: 
* [http://issuu.com/russmaschmeyer/docs/motiv-process-book](http://issuu.com/russmaschmeyer/docs/motiv-process-book) \(process\)
* [http://musicwithmotiv.com](http://musicwithmotiv.com) \(project\)


### Reading
Readings will be distributed as pdfs or through NYU's online library access

#### Recommended Books
* [Do The Work! by Steven Pressfield](https://www.amazon.com/Do-Work-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B00NK0MJBK)


### Grading and Attendance Policy
The assignments are designed to test and deepen your knowledge while giving me valuable information about how you’re progressing in the class. Remember, **finished is better than perfect**. An attempt at an assignment that does not meet your expectations is better than nothing at all.

Your in-class participation counts towards your grade. This means you are expected to be actively engaged in class discussions, attentive to other students, and mentally present in the classroom and on excursions. We will be having active discussions in class. If you are not naturally a talker, this is your chance to become one.

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

**Quantitative Grading Overview**

* 15% Weekly submissions to documentation website
* 15% Critiques, Demos, Presentations & Exhibition
* 30% Final Project 
* 40% End of Semester Documentation and Deliverables

**Qualitative Grading Overview**

Each student will be judged on the iteration & improvement \(process\), craft & completion \(execution\), and documentation & presentation of their senior project work.

* **A Excellent**
Process, execution, documentation & presentation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class, exceeding expections.

* **B Very Good / Good**
Process, execution, documentation & presentation, and attendance of students has been, good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average sensitivity to senior project and meets expectations.

* **C Satisfactory**
Process, execution, documentation & presentation, and attendance of the students has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of senior project.

* **D Poor / Below Average**
Process, execution, documentation & presentation, and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many areas that show any understanding of senior project. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, and/or poor time management.

* **F Unacceptable**
Process, execution, documentation & presentation, and attendance of the student has been such that the student has failed course requirements. Work shows no overall understanding of senior project on many levels, and/or a severe lack of interest.

### Academic Honesty

Please review [NYU Tandon's academic dishonesty policy](https://engineering.nyu.edu/campus-and-community/student-life/office-student-affairs/policies/student-code-conduct) in its entirety.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual style for citing and documenting source material.

You MUST have complete rights of use to any and all materials which appear in your senior project. This includes images, illustrations, audio etc. The source of any materials NOT created by you MUST be documented. Please remember that you can collaborate with other students to create your own media or contact the authors of your media selections for rights. I strongly encourage you to use original media for your senior project, however should you absolutely require to use stock images, video, etc., you will need to provide a PDF of all source files and the usage rights you have purchased/negotiated or whether it is creative commons or copyright free.

### Academic Accommodations

If you are student with a disability who is requesting accommodations, please contact New York University’s Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu. You must be registered with CSD to receive accommodations. Information about the Moses Center can be found at [http://www.nyu.edu/csd](http://www.nyu.edu/csd). The Moses Center is located at [726 Broadway](https://www.google.com/maps?q=726+Broadway&entry=gmail&source=g) on the 2nd floor.

### Diversity and Inclusion

The TCS Department is dedicated to the university's goals for diversity, equity and inclusion. NYU is committed to building a culture that respects and embraces diversity, inclusion, and equity, believing that these values – in all their facets – are, as President Andrew Hamilton said, “…not only important to cherish for their own sake, but because they are also vital for advancing knowledge, sparking innovation, and creating sustainable communities. They should be indispensable elements of an NYU education on all of our campuses. A diverse population encounters and appreciates all perspectives of an issue with a wealth of different approaches to confront it. The result is a higher quality of debate, and a more excellent and advanced academic enterprise.”

### Title IX

Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, etc. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find the appropriate resources here [https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/title9.html](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/title9.html)
