# Storytelling

Telling stoies is a powerful toool. We do this in all kinds of work, design, art, writing, even in play. In the telling of stories, we strive too conveying our ideas. 

For this exercise, Select 20 images that create a visual story about your project idea - do not include any text at all. Only use one image per screen. Prepare this like a Pecha Kucha so that you only have 20 seconds per image. Use the slides to tell the story you want to convey. Do this with your firends, accountability partner(s), anyone you can get to sit still and worth through your ideas with them afterwards.

* If you already have a project idea, this audio \(optional\), visual \(required\) presentation should cover all perspectives, concepts and ideas you can think about. Donâ€™t limit yourself but broaden up.
* If you do not have a specific project, select 20 things that you consider relevant to your general project idea or 20 things that you are interested in.
