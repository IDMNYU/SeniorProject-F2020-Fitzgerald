## What to brush up on ....
* Your portfolio website NOTE: This is different than your process website.  This website should market and promote your entire body of work including your senior project for possible employment or other post graduation opportunities. Ideally, you should have your own domain name. I suggest getting your own domain name through an ISP (Internet Service Provider. [Siteground])(http://siteground.com/), [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com), and [Squarespace](http://Squarespace.com) are all good options.
* Your LinkedIn profile. Make sure you connect with me, your peers in this section of senior project, the other senior project sections, and with as many people as possible in the IDM community. Continue to build your network.
* Resume (which should contain the URL to your portfolio website)
* Cover Letter writing

## Professional Practices Resources
* [NYU Photo Bureau](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/office-of-the-president/university-relationsandpublicaffairs/public-affairs/photo-bureau.html) - Students can get free headshots from the NYU Photo Bureau. I highly recommend that you take advantage of it for your portfolio website and LinkedIn profile. It's a very popular service.
